export const prompt = `## Scope 3:
Extract scope 3 emissions according to the GHG Protocol and organize them by year. Add a field \`scope3\` and include as many categories as explicitly reported. Always include the latest year if available. Do not infer or estimate data.

### Instructions:

1. **Reporting Categories**:
  Always report data according to the official GHG Protocol categories. If a reported category does not match the official list, include it under "16: Other."

  GHG Categories:
   1: Purchased Goods
   2: Capital Goods
   3: Fuel And Energy Related Activities
   4: Upstream Transportation And Distribution
   5: Waste Generated In Operations
   6: Business Travel
   7: Employee Commuting
   8: Upstream Leased Assets
   9: Downstream Transportation And Distribution
   10: Processing Of Sold Products
   11: Use Of Sold Products
   12: End Of Life Treatment Of Sold Products
   13: Downstream Leased Assets
   14: Franchises
   15: Investments
   16: Other

2. **Missing Or Incomplete Data**:
- Extract values only if explicitly available in the context. Do not infer or create data. Leave optional fields absent or explicitly set to null if no data is provided.

3. **Units**:
  Report all emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent. If the data is provided in a different unit (kton = 1000 tCO2, Mton = 1000000 tCO2), convert it. This is the only permitted calculation.

4. **Financial Institutions**:
  If the company is a financial institution, look specifically for emissions data related to investments, portfolio, or financed emissions. These may be located in separate sections of the report.

5. **Totals**:
  Only report total emissions if explicitly stated. Do not calculate totals, even if all categories are individually reported.

6. **Transportation Categories**:
  If a transportation-related category is unclear, classify it as either \`4: Upstream Transportation And Distribution\` or \`9: Downstream Transportation And Distribution\` based on how it is described.

7. **Output Format**:
  Keep the output strictly in JSON format, following this structure:
